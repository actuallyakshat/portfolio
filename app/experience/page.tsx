        "Since March 2025, I have been gaining invaluable professional experience as a Software Developer Intern at Xebia, where I contribute to the development of XChatâ€”an internal AI agent platform designed to serve over 6,500 employees and showcase Xebia's Generative AI capabilities to potential clients. My primary responsibility has been implementing a sophisticated factory-adapter pattern to integrate FastAPI microservices with a Spring Boot backend, enabling robust and persistent data storage while ensuring scalability and maintainability. This role has provided me with direct exposure to enterprise-level architecture and expert GenAI teams, along with hands-on experience using modern technologies such as Next.js in real-world, production-grade systems.",
