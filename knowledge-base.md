## Projects and Experience

### Tell me about your most significant project.

My most significant project is Daily 150, a privacy-first journaling platform. It features end-to-end encryption (AES-GCM) to ensure secure storage of user entries. I built it with a scalable, event-driven architecture using Redis queues and Go workers for efficient batch processing of AI-generated summaries. The project also includes optimization of API rate limits for the Gemini summarization feature and a Chrome extension that encourages consistent journaling by blocking social media until the daily entry is complete.

### What was your role in Daily 150?

I was the lead developer for Daily 150, responsible for the entire application architecture and implementation. This included designing the encryption system, building the event-driven architecture with Redis queues, implementing the API integrations with Gemini, and developing the Chrome extension.

### What technologies did you use in Daily 150?

For Daily 150, I used Go and Express.js for the backend, React for the frontend, Redis for queuing and caching, PostgreSQL for database storage, Cron jobs for scheduled tasks, and the Gemini API for AI-powered summarization. I also implemented Railway for deployment.

### What were the biggest challenges you faced in Daily 150 and how did you overcome them?

The biggest challenges in Daily 150 included:

1. Implementing secure end-to-end encryption while maintaining functionality
2. Managing API rate limits for Gemini summarization
3. Ensuring system reliability under high loads

I overcame these challenges by implementing AES-GCM encryption, developing token bucket algorithms with request retries and intelligent text chunking for API optimization, and designing a fault-tolerant pipeline with automated retry and error-handling mechanisms.

### What were the key achievements or outcomes of Daily 150?

The key achievements of Daily 150 include:

1. Successfully implementing end-to-end encryption for user privacy
2. Building a scalable architecture that efficiently handles batch processing
3. Creating an effective AI summarization pipeline that works within API rate limits
4. Developing a Chrome extension that helps users build a journaling habit
5. Maintaining system reliability even under high load conditions

### Can you tell me about a project where you used Next.js?

Cinevault is a project where I extensively used Next.js. It's a platform for discovering, managing, and sharing movies and TV shows with personalized profiles and social features. I integrated the TMDB API for movie data, Cloudinary for image management, Clerk for authentication, and Prisma ORM for database operations. The project features "Movie Boards" that allow users to curate and collaborate on collections, and includes social interactions through profiles and recommendations.

### What kind of problems do your projects solve?

My projects solve various practical problems:

- Daily 150 addresses privacy concerns in journaling and helps users build consistent habits
- Cinevault simplifies movie discovery and enables social sharing of recommendations
- Multiplayer Wordle adds a real-time competitive element to a popular word game
- Zipit streamlines secure file sharing with automatic cleanup

### What was your experience like working at Xebia?

I'm currently working at Xebia as a Software Developer Intern (started February 2025). I'm working on XChat, a hub for various AI agent use cases that will serve 6500+ Xebians. I implemented an adapter pattern to integrate FastAPI microservices with Spring Boot for data persistence, creating a scalable and maintainable codebase. The project showcases Xebia's Gen AI solutions to potential clients. This role has given me direct exposure to Gen AI teams and hands-on experience with Next.js and enterprise-level architecture patterns.

### What were your responsibilities at Xebia?

At Xebia, I am working as a Software Developer Intern on the XChat project, which is a hub for various AI agent use cases designed to serve over 6500 Xebians. My responsibilities include developing and implementing features for XChat. A key aspect of my work has been implementing an adapter pattern to integrate FastAPI microservices with Spring Boot for robust data persistence, which has been crucial for creating a scalable and maintainable codebase. This role involves hands-on experience with Next.js and understanding enterprise-level architecture patterns. I also gain direct exposure to Xebia's Gen AI teams.

### Can you tell me about a time you had to work in a team?

Yes, my current internship at Xebia as a Software Developer Intern on the XChat project is a strong example of working in a team. XChat is a complex internal tool serving a large number of Xebians, and its development naturally requires close collaboration with other developers, potentially designers, product owners, and the Gen AI teams I interact with. Building a hub for diverse AI agent use cases and implementing an adapter pattern to integrate different services (FastAPI and Spring Boot) necessitates effective teamwork to ensure smooth integration, code quality, and timely delivery of features. While the resume mentions teamwork indirectly, my daily work on XChat is fundamentally collaborative.

### What was your proudest accomplishment in your career so far?

I have a couple of accomplishments I'm particularly proud of, but my most recent and significant has been leading the development of the XChat product during my internship at Xebia. It's a project I single-handedly led, and in a span of just four weeks, I was able to ship over 200,000 lines of code. XChat serves as a vital hub for integrating various Gen AI agent use cases for real-world application within the company, serving over 6500 Xebians. This involved integrating a wide range of features commonly found on sophisticated chatbot platforms. The scale and speed of development, combined with its direct impact and use of cutting-edge Gen AI, make it a stand-out achievement for me.
Separately, I'm also very proud of the architectural design and implementation of Daily 150. Creating a privacy-first platform with end-to-end encryption, implementing a scalable event-driven system with Redis queues and Go workers, and building a fault-tolerant pipeline for AI summarization demonstrated my technical abilities across the full stack in a different domain.
