### Tell me about your most significant project.

My most significant project to date is Daily 150, a privacy-first journaling platform I developed. A core feature is its implementation of robust end-to-end encryption using AES-GCM, ensuring that user entries are stored securely and privately. I designed and built the platform with a scalable, event-driven architecture, utilizing Redis queues and Go workers to efficiently handle batch processing tasks, such as generating AI summaries. I also focused on optimizing API rate limits for the Gemini summarization feature through intelligent text chunking and retry mechanisms. A unique aspect of the project is a companion Chrome extension designed to encourage consistent journaling habits by temporarily blocking access to social media until the daily entry is completed.

### What was your role in Daily 150?

I served as the lead developer for the Daily 150 project, taking full ownership of the application's architecture, design, and implementation. My responsibilities included conceptualizing and building the end-to-end encryption system, designing and implementing the scalable event-driven architecture with Redis queues, integrating and optimizing the API calls to the Gemini model, and developing the accompanying Chrome extension.

### What technologies did you use in Daily 150?

The Daily 150 project utilized a modern and diverse technology stack. The backend was built using Go and Express.js. The frontend was developed with React. Redis was employed for queuing and caching functionalities. PostgreSQL served as the primary database for storing user data. Cron jobs were used for scheduling tasks, and the Gemini API powered the AI-driven summarization feature. The application was deployed using Railway.

### What were the biggest challenges you faced in Daily 150 and how did you overcome them?

Developing Daily 150 presented several significant challenges:

1.  **Implementing secure end-to-end encryption:** Ensuring strong encryption (AES-GCM) while maintaining application usability and performance was a key challenge. I overcame this by carefully designing the encryption flow and managing keys securely.
2.  **Managing API rate limits for Gemini summarization:** Integrating the Gemini API required careful handling of rate limits to avoid exceeding quotas and ensure reliable summarization. I addressed this by implementing token bucket algorithms, request retries, and intelligent text chunking to optimize API usage.
3.  **Ensuring system reliability under high loads:** Designing the system to remain stable and responsive as the number of users and entries grew was crucial. I achieved this by building a fault-tolerant pipeline with automated retry mechanisms and robust error handling for background processing tasks.

### What were the key achievements or outcomes of Daily 150?

The Daily 150 project resulted in several key achievements:

1.  Successfully implemented robust end-to-end encryption, providing users with a high level of privacy for their sensitive journal entries.
2.  Built a scalable and efficient event-driven architecture capable of handling batch processing tasks effectively.
3.  Created an effective AI summarization pipeline that operates reliably within the constraints of external API rate limits.
4.  Developed a unique Chrome extension that successfully encourages users to build and maintain a consistent journaling habit.
5.  Designed and implemented a system that demonstrates high reliability and resilience, even when operating under significant load conditions.

### Can you tell me about a project where you used Next.js?

Cinevault is a prime example of a project where I extensively utilized Next.js. This platform is designed for users to discover, manage, and share movies and TV shows, featuring personalized profiles and social interaction capabilities. I integrated several external services and technologies, including the TMDB API for comprehensive movie and TV show data, Cloudinary for efficient image management, and Clerk for secure user authentication.
